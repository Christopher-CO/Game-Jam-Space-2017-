Take note: 

Unity projects have a bunch of assets way over GitHub's individual file size limits, so we have to use something called Git Large File Storage (git lfs) to be able to push repositories. 

Get it here: https://git-lfs.github.com/

Make sure you run 'git lfs install'

If you run into problems, this is also helpful:
